Hi there,
how are you?
  As you wrote numbers and probabilities are way too many and i gree with you
but for istance i was thinking something maybe could be done

i did not make the real calculaioon of that but if for example,,

we have a tool which can make all the possible different combinations of keys and after tht we split in the same number of all the people we can be,
  so first of all we cut the double counting  and maybe working at the same timeframe we can make it in a decent period of time.
  let's say is some thi g like 500 people of us (maybe more maybe less)
  let's say we make a powergroup of people working each of us atthe same time frame to a single split of that..
  Do you think possibilities are going to be the same waste of time?
